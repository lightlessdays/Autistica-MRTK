Autism is an inborn, lifelong developmental disability that is predominantly genetic. Signs of autism include developmental delays, out-of-the-box thinking, repetitive behavior, sensory sensitivities, sincerity, and specific passionate interests. Every autistic person gets a different mix of traits. Autism Spectrum Disorders are widespread and affect every 6 people in 10000 according to Autism Europe site1 . The disorder is chiefly characterized by impairments in social interaction and by repetitive and stereotyped behavior. (Source: Wikimedia Commons).

Mark Lever, Chief Executive of the National Autistic Society says that "Almost everyone has heard of autism now but we continue to hear from autistic people and their families who miss out on an education, struggle to find work or become extremely isolated - often due to misunderstandings about autism and what it’s like to be autistic. Better understanding of autism could transform the lives of hundreds of thousands of autistic people.”

We have clearly defined and outlined goals with are project, that include (but are not limited to):
- Helping autistic children (specifically teenagers) to get help easily.
- Making diagnosis of autism easy by providing immersive experiences in devices like Oculus Quest 2, Hololens 2, Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest Pro and the likes of them.
- Spreading awareness about autism and what we can do to deal with this.
- Helping autistic children improve their neural, auditory and visual responses and thinking capabilities 

Our product uses immersive tech devices, like the Hololens 2 to guide autistic children through immersive and intensive therapy sessions to improve their muscle memory, vocal skills and eye coordination. The technology can be used to create virtual environments to help autistic people prepare for encounters or situations that could stimulate autistic responses in them. Certain fears and phobias that severely impact autistic children have also been tackled with alternate reality (mixed reality and virtual reality). These phobias can include, a fear of public transport, classrooms, balloons, and animals.  The use of technology allows exposure in the “real world” to train skills in a virtual environment, which is deemed safer. The responses of the children can be monitored by psychologists that can further investigate the case. This serves two purposes: (i) improves the sensory responses of autistic children and (ii) makes the job of psychologist of diagnosing children much easier.
